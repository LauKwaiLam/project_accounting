Problem statement:

Accounting system (Shumin)
background information:
Learn how to manage our financial status is an important lesson for all of us. More and more people
choose to use digital tools to manage their wealth efficiently.

Aim:

shall include basic functions including

1) add records of income and expenses; 

2) the records should contain some basic information, like amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game,
salary, etc.), account (e.g cash, bank card, credit card, etc.);(4 col)

3) the records could be deleted and edited
at any time;

budget, there should be an alert from the system.

7) create a funtion to see the trend of the expense, warn if it exceed a certain threshold.

problem setting:
Assume that the goal is a constant


how about we make a two dimension array?
Acc_system[num of row][num of col]
num of row= number of user
num of col= number of entity

the datum are saved in a text file such as (seperated by " "):
1000 20190326 1337 food cash
